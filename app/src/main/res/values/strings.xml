    <string name="android_text">"I am interested in Android OS development. Having the most up-to-date version of android is impossible in most cases... This is due to the fact that the phone manufacturer fulfills its obligation and provides the update only for a certain time. Most manufacturers only provide updates for 2-3 years. As a result, the phone loses support and can no longer be updated and becomes less and less secure over time. That's why I have become interested in Android OS development and learned to create my own versions of Android OS. In the past, I managed an unofficial version of LineageOs 14.1 for my old phone Asus ZenFone 2. After a while, I no longer had a powerful enough PC for development, so I decided to become a user... However, recently I started re-releasing custom versions of Android OS for Xiaomi Mi A2 based on LineageOs 18.1 (Android 11). "</string>

    <string name="hardver_text">"I also do not disdain information about the latest PC hardware. I've never had a pre-assembled computer, I've always bought components and assembled them myself. I currently have a computer with an AMD Ryzen 3 1200 processor, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 GPU, 16GB of RAM and an SSD drive. I have put it together back in 2015 and I am gradually improving it. The computer has already undergone many upgrades... In the basic configuration, when I have assembled it for the first time, it had only one HDD, 8 GB of RAM and a GTX 1050. "</string>
